# Feature Specification: Portfolio Management System

**Feature Branch**: `001-portfolio-management-system`  
**Created**: 2025-09-20  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "We are building a Portfolio management system. User must be able the create and update his profession profiles. The profile must consists of multiple sections that the user can manage independently: including but not limited to summary, education, professional experience and other sections that commonly appear in a resume. User must be able to upload media files and create links to external projects to enrich his profile. MAJOR FEATURE: the user must be able to generate a resume pdf file with a latex template. the user must be able to view and edit his profile via a web interface. The user should be able to share his profile with another user and public accessible links (configurable)."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a professional, I want to create and manage my portfolio profile so that I can showcase my skills and experiences to potential employers or clients. I also want to generate a professional resume PDF from my profile data and share my profile with others through configurable links.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user has created an account, **When** they navigate to their profile page, **Then** they can view, create, and update all sections of their professional profile.
2. **Given** a user has populated their profile with data, **When** they request to generate a resume PDF, **Then** the system generates a professional PDF document using a LaTeX template based on their profile data.
3. **Given** a user has a complete profile, **When** they configure sharing settings, **Then** they can generate public links and share their profile with specific users.
4. **Given** a user wants to add media to their profile, **When** they upload files or add external project links, **Then** these enrichments are displayed in their profile.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user tries to generate a resume PDF with incomplete profile data?
- How does system handle large media file uploads?
- How does system handle invalid external project links?
- What happens when a user tries to access a shared profile with an expired or invalid link?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to create and update professional profile sections including summary, education, and professional experience
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow users to manage profile sections independently
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to upload media files to enrich their profile
- **FR-004**: Users MUST be able to create links to external projects to enrich their profile
- **FR-005**: System MUST generate a resume PDF file using a LaTeX template based on user profile data
- **FR-006**: Users MUST be able to view and edit their profile via a web interface
- **FR-007**: Users MUST be able to share their profile with other users through configurable public links
- **FR-008**: System MUST allow users to configure privacy settings for their profile sharing
- **FR-009**: System MUST persist all user profile data and sharing configurations

### Observability Requirements
- **OR-001**: System MUST emit structured logs for profile creation, update, and PDF generation operations
- **OR-002**: System MUST track metrics for profile views, PDF generations, and file uploads

### Key Entities
- **UserProfile**: Represents a user's complete professional profile containing multiple sections. Linked to external identity provider via OAuth 2.0 subject identifier.
