# Research Findings: Minimal HTTP API with Health Check Endpoint

## Performance Requirements for Health Check Endpoints

**Decision**: Health check endpoints should respond within 100ms under normal conditions, with a target of 99.9% availability.

**Rationale**:
- Health checks are meant to be lightweight and fast
- Most load balancers and orchestration tools have timeouts in the 100-1000ms range
- A 100ms target allows for sufficient headroom while maintaining responsiveness
- This aligns with common industry practices for health check endpoints

**Alternatives considered**:
- 10ms: Too aggressive and may cause false negatives due to transient issues
- 1000ms: Too lenient and may not catch performance issues early
- Variable based on service: More complex to implement and maintain

## Deployment Constraints for Go Services

**Decision**: Deploy as a standalone binary with configuration via environment variables or HCL files.

**Rationale**:
- Go binaries are self-contained and easy to deploy
- Environment variables are standard for containerized deployments
- HCL configuration provides type safety and documentation
- This approach works well with Docker, Kubernetes, and other container orchestration platforms

**Alternatives considered**:
- OS packages: More complex deployment and dependency management
- Configuration via command line flags only: Limited flexibility
- External configuration services: Unnecessary complexity for a simple service

## Best Practices for danielgtaylor/huma in Health Check Services

**Decision**: Use Huma's OpenAPI generation capabilities with explicit health check response models.

**Rationale**:
- Huma provides automatic OpenAPI documentation generation
- Strong typing with response models ensures documentation accuracy
- Built-in validation helps catch errors early
- Clean separation between API definition and implementation
- Huma is specifically designed for modern REST/HTTP RPC APIs in Go with OpenAPI 3.1 and JSON Schema backing

**Key Features Utilized**:
- Declarative interface on top of chosen router
- Operation & model documentation
- Request parameters, bodies, responses, and errors handling
- JSON Errors using RFC9457 and application/problem+json by default
- Per-operation request size limits
- Content negotiation (JSON, CBOR) via Accept header
- Conditional requests (If-Match, If-Unmodified-Since)
- Annotated Go types for input/output models that generate JSON Schema
- Static typing for parameters, bodies, response headers
- Automatic input model validation & error handling
- Documentation generation using Stoplight Elements
- Optional built-in CLI for port configuration and startup actions
- Generates OpenAPI for ecosystem tools (mocks, SDKs, CLIs)
- Generates JSON Schema for resources with 'describedby' link relation headers and '$schema' properties

**Alternatives considered**:
- Standard net/http: More verbose and no automatic documentation
- Gin/Gorilla Mux: Good middleware support but no built-in OpenAPI generation
- gRPC: Overkill for simple health check functionality

## Best Practices for uber/fx Dependency Injection in Go

**Decision**: Use uber/fx for dependency injection to manage service lifecycle and configuration.

**Rationale**:
- uber/fx provides compile-time safety for dependency injection
- Simplifies testing through easy mocking and injection
- Manages lifecycle of dependencies (startup/shutdown)
- Integrates well with structured logging and observability
- Fx is a dependency injection based application framework for Go that offers guard rails to prevent common mistakes

**Key Features Utilized**:
- fx.In struct embedding for parameter objects
- fx.Out struct embedding for result objects
- fx.Provide for registering constructors
- fx.Invoke for functions that should always run
- fx.Decorate for modifying existing dependencies
- fx.Private for restricting component scope
- Module system for organizing dependencies
- Value groups for collecting multiple implementations

**Alternatives considered**:
- Manual dependency injection: Error-prone and verbose
- Other DI frameworks (dig, fx-like libraries): uber/fx is the most mature
- Global variables: Poor testability and unclear dependencies

## Best Practices for OpenTelemetry Integration with zap Logging

**Decision**: Use OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing and metrics, with zap for structured logging.

**Rationale**:
- OpenTelemetry is the industry standard for observability
- zap provides fast, structured logging with low allocation overhead
- Integration between OpenTelemetry and zap is well-supported
- Both libraries are widely adopted and actively maintained
- OpenTelemetry provides a vendor-neutral, open-source observability framework

**Key Features Utilized**:
- OpenTelemetry Logs API for structured logging
- zap's high-performance structured logging
- Trace context correlation in logging bridges
- Standardized severity levels and log record structure
- OTLP/gRPC and OTLP/HTTP exporters for telemetry data
- Stdout exporters for development and debugging

**Implementation Approach**:
- Use zap for application logging with structured fields
- Use OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing and metrics collection
- Correlate trace context with log records for better debugging
- Export telemetry data to appropriate backends based on environment

**Alternatives considered**:
- Standard library logging: Lacks structure and observability features
- logrus: Slower than zap and less actively maintained
- Custom logging solution: Unnecessary complexity and maintenance burden

## Best Practices for HCL Configuration with hclsimple

**Decision**: Use HCL for structured configuration files with hclsimple for parsing.

**Rationale**:
- HCL provides a good balance between human and machine readability
- hclsimple makes parsing straightforward with good error messages
- Schema validation ensures configuration correctness
- Supports comments and complex data structures
- HCL is a toolkit for creating structured configuration languages that are human- and machine-friendly

**Key Features Utilized**:
- hclsimple.DecodeFile for simple HCL file decoding
- Struct tags for mapping HCL attributes to Go struct fields
- Block syntax for hierarchical configuration
- Expression evaluation with evaluation contexts
- Diagnostic reporting for configuration errors
- JSON compatibility for programmatic configuration generation

**Alternatives considered**:
- JSON: Harder to read and write for humans, no comments
- YAML: Error-prone due to indentation sensitivity
- TOML: Less expressive than HCL for complex configurations
- Environment variables only: Limited structure and type safety

## Best Practices for Cobra CLI Applications

**Decision**: Use cobra for CLI command structure and argument parsing.

**Rationale**:
- cobra is the de facto standard for Go CLI applications
- Provides automatic help generation and flag parsing
- Well-documented with extensive examples
- Used by major projects like Kubernetes, Docker, etc.
- Supports subcommands, POSIX-compliant flags, and automatic help generation

**Key Features Utilized**:
- Command structure with Use, Short, and Long descriptions
- Flag definitions with PersistentFlags and Flags
- Subcommand organization with AddCommand
- Argument validation with Args field
- Command lifecycle hooks (PreRun, PostRun, etc.)
- Shell completion generation
- Help text generation

**Alternatives considered**:
- Standard flag package: Limited functionality and no subcommand support
- kingpin: Good but less community adoption
- urfave/cli: Popular but cobra has better documentation and examples

## Best Practices for Ginkgo Testing Framework

**Decision**: Use Ginkgo for BDD-style testing with Gomega for assertions.

**Rationale**:
- Ginkgo provides clear, expressive test structure
- Good integration with Go's testing package
- Gomega provides fluent assertions that are easy to read
- Supports table-driven tests and focused tests
- Good documentation and community support
- Ginkgo is a mature testing framework for Go that provides an expressive DSL for writing clear and organized test specifications

**Key Features Utilized**:
- Describe, Context, and It blocks for organizing tests
- BeforeEach and AfterEach for setup and teardown
- Table-driven tests with DescribeTable and Entry
- Asynchronous testing with SpecContext
- Label filtering for test organization
- Spec decorators like Serial and FlakeAttempts
- Integration with Gomega matcher library

**Alternatives considered**:
- Standard testing package: Less expressive for complex test scenarios
- Testify: Popular but can be verbose
- GoConvey: Web UI is nice but adds complexity
