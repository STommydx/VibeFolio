# Feature Specification: Minimal HTTP API with Health Check Endpoint

**Feature Branch**: `001-before-building-any`
**Created**: 2025-09-21
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Before building any actual functionality, build a minimal HTTP API with only healthz endpoint for bootstrapping the project. The endpoint must return a status code based on the service health. The endpoint should have a JSON response with the status. The user must be able to config the port the HTTP server is listening to. The API project must be architeched to be future proof for multi layer structure mentioned in constitution."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer or system administrator, I want to have a minimal HTTP API with a health check endpoint so that I can verify the service is running and ready to handle requests before adding more complex functionality.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the service is running, **When** I make a GET request to the /healthz endpoint, **Then** I should receive a 200 OK status code with a JSON response indicating the service is healthy.
2. **Given** the service is configured with a specific port, **When** I make a request to that port, **Then** the service should respond on that port.
3. **Given** the service is starting up, **When** the health check is performed, **Then** the response should accurately reflect the current state of the service.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the service is in an unhealthy state?
- How does the system handle invalid port configurations?
- What happens when the port is already in use by another service?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a /healthz endpoint that returns the health status of the service
- **FR-002**: System MUST return a 200 OK status code when the service is healthy
- **FR-003**: System MUST return a JSON response with health status information
- **FR-004**: Users MUST be able to configure the port the HTTP server listens on
- **FR-005**: System MUST be architected with a multi-layer structure to support future expansion
- **FR-006**: System MUST validate the port configuration and provide appropriate error messages for invalid configurations

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
No key entities involved in this feature.
