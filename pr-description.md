- Media file upload and management
- External link management
- Profile sharing with configurable privacy settings
- Resume PDF generation using LaTeX templates

### Authentication & Authorization
- OAuth 2.0 integration with Google and GitHub providers
- Secure session management
- Role-based access control

### Technical Architecture
- RESTful API built with Huma framework
- Data persistence with ent ORM and SQLite
- Embedded NATS JetStream server for messaging and object storage
- Structured logging with zap and OpenTelemetry tracing
- Configuration management with HCL and XDG compliance

### Interfaces
- CLI interface with commands for all major operations
- Server-side rendered UI components using templ and HTMX
- Comprehensive API documentation with OpenAPI specification

### Quality Assurance
- Contract tests for all API endpoints
- Integration tests for all major features
- Unit tests for core services
- Performance and security audits
- Observability validation

## Project Structure

The implementation follows a clean, modular architecture:

└── cmd/             # CLI entry points
```

## Getting Started

1. Build the application:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   go build -o vibefolio .
   ```

2. Run the server:
   ```bash
   ./vibefolio serve
   ```

3. Use the CLI:
   ```bash
   # Create a new profile
   ./vibefolio create-profile --public
   
   # Manage profile sections
   ./vibefolio manage-sections
   
   # Generate a resume
   ./vibefolio generate-resume --template=default
   ```

4. Access the API at `localhost:8080`

## Testing

The implementation includes a comprehensive test suite:
- Contract tests for all API endpoints
- Integration tests for all major features
- Unit tests for core services
- Performance tests for critical operations
- Security audits of authentication and authorization

## Documentation

Comprehensive documentation is available:
- API documentation with OpenAPI specification
- User guide and quickstart instructions
- Security audit reports
- Performance benchmark results

## Future Improvements

While the core implementation is complete, there are some areas for future enhancement:
- Refinement of UI components and HTMX interactions
- Additional OAuth providers (LinkedIn, etc.)
- Advanced profile customization options
- Template marketplace for resume designs
