# VibeFolio Health Check API Implementation

## Overview

This implementation provides a minimal HTTP API with a health check endpoint as specified in the requirements. The service listens on a configurable port and responds to GET requests at `/healthz` with a JSON response indicating the service health status.

## Features Implemented

### Core Functionality
- ✅ HTTP server with Huma framework
- ✅ GET `/healthz` endpoint returning health status
- ✅ JSON response with status, timestamp, and version
- ✅ Configurable port via environment variables
- ✅ Graceful shutdown handling

### Architecture
- ✅ Layered architecture (models → services → controllers)
- ✅ Dependency injection with Uber FX
- ✅ Structured logging with Zap
- ✅ Observability with OpenTelemetry tracing
- ✅ CLI interface with Cobra

### Testing
- ✅ Contract tests (3/3 passing)
- ✅ Integration tests (4/4 passing)
- ✅ Unit tests (27/27 passing)
- ✅ Performance tests
- ✅ Load tests

### Configuration
- ✅ Environment variable configuration parsing
- ✅ Partial implementation of HCL and flag configuration parsers

## Current Limitations

### Incomplete Configuration Integration
While the specification in `quickstart.md` clearly states that the service should support three configuration methods:
1. Command line flags
2. Environment variables
3. HCL configuration files

The current implementation only fully integrates **environment variable parsing**. The HCL and flag parsers have been implemented as separate components but are not currently used by the application.

**Files implemented but not integrated:**
- `src/config/hcl_parser.go` - HCL configuration parser
- `src/config/flag_parser.go` - Command-line flag parser

**File removed (unused):**
- `src/config/env_parser.go` - Environment variable parser (functionality moved to ConfigService)

## Usage

### Building
```bash
go build -o bin/vibectl cmd/vibectl/main.go
```

### Running
```bash
# Default port (9090)
./bin/vibectl serve

# Custom port via environment variable
PORT=8080 ./bin/vibectl serve

# Help
./bin/vibectl serve --help
```

### Testing Health Endpoint
```bash
curl http://localhost:9090/healthz
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2025-09-21T10:00:00Z",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "details": {
    "service": "VibeFolio Health Check"
  }
}
```

## Future Improvements

To fully implement all configuration methods as specified:

1. **Integrate HCL parser** - Modify ConfigService to load configuration from HCL files
2. **Integrate flag parser** - Modify ConfigService to parse command-line flags
3. **Implement configuration merging** - Establish priority order (flags > env > HCL > defaults)
4. **Add validation** - Ensure configuration values are validated across all sources

## Test Results

All tests are currently passing:
- Contract Tests: 3/3
- Integration Tests: 4/4
- Unit Tests: 27/27

Run tests with: `ginkgo -r`
